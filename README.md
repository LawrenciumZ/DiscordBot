Documentation for myself
What is needed in a discord bot, commands, interations between bot and server and api keys.
When making the discord bot, we need to communicate with the discord app. Commands have the data to recieve and then executes the command.
Loop through the folders and read the subfolders, then read the files, filtering the .js files to ensure that there are only java commands in the commands folder.
